# TotalFreedomMod #

TotalFreedomMod is a CraftBukkit server plugin designed primarily to support the [Official TotalFreedom Minecraft Server](http://totalfreedom.me/). However, you are more than welcome to adapt the source for your own server.

This plugin was originally coded by Steven Lawson (Madgeek1450), with Jerom van der Sar (Prozza) becoming heavily involved in its development some time later. It consists of over 85 custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together, with the main TotalFreedom server, TotalFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feeling of openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.

### Please keep the following: ###

Always keep `/totalfreedommod` (alias: `/tfm`) as a command. It gives the main developers credit for what they've originally started.

In the FUtil class file, it would be nice if you keep the UMCDEVS list there, but you must keep the TFDEVS list in the file Not doing so will result in consequences from an actual TotalFreedom developer.

### Download ###
You may download official binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/TotalFreedom/TotalFreedomMod/releases).

# UnraveledMCMod #
UnraveledMCMod is a clone of TotalFreedomMod that's heavily modified. Now because it's cloned, we must comply with the TFM license:

Due to the the TFM license, we are not allowed to release official release jars of the plugin. You must compile the plugin with netbeans. Attempting to obtain money for compiling the plugin is strictly forbidden and illegal.

You're also **not allowed** to send the compiled versions of TFM/UMCM to anyone. That's against the license.
