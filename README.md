# UnraveledMCMod #
A server modification for the UnraveledMC server.


Please read the following below:
# TotalFreedomMod #

TotalFreedomMod is a CraftBukkit server plugin designed primarily to support the [Official TotalFreedom Minecraft Server](http://totalfreedom.me/). However, you are more than welcome to adapt the source for your own server.

This plugin was originally coded by StevenLawson (Madgeek1450), with Jerom van der Sar (Prozza) becoming heavily involved in its development some time later. It consists of over 85 custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together, with the main TotalFreedom server, TotalFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feeling of openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.

### Please keep the following: ##

Always keep /totalfreedommod (/tfm) as a command. It gives the main developers credit for what they originally started.

In the Util file, it would be nice to keep the UMC_DEVS but you must keep the TF_DEVS list in the Util. Not doing so may result in consequences from an actual TotalFreedom Developer.

### Download ###
